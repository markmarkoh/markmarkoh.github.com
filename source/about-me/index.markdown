I'm an Austin, TX based <b>javascript</b> developer at [Bazaarvoice][1] on the [Customer Intelligence][2] team. 

I work primarily with: 

  *  [Ember.js][3]
  *  [D3.js / Protovis][4]
  *  [Handlebars.js][7]
  *  [requirejs][10]
  *  [jQuery][5]
  *  [Modernizr][6]

 *Customer Intelligence* is a large-scale HTML5 data vizualization & data analysis application. We analyze and interpret product reviews and offer insights based on segment analysis, natural language processing and trend tracking.

 Since releasing a v1, I've shifted gears to rapid prototyping future features and performing targetted user testing.

Before Bazaarvoice
-----------

Before joining Bazaarvoice I founded one startup, [Press 9 For More Options][8], an A/B testing application & framework, and was the 5<sup>th</sup> hire at a now defunct Austin-based startup called eProoft.


Untech
--------
I listen to [music][9] nonstop, eat gourmet trailer food and rarely miss an episode of *the Daily Show*. I'm also trying to read all the biographies of 20<sup>th</sup> century phsysists and other famous scientists.
