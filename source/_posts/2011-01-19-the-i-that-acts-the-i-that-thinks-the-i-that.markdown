{% blockquote ["Niels Bohr"] %}
 I start to think about my own thoughts of the situation in which I find myself. I even think that I think of it, and divide myself into an infinite retrogressive sequence of "I's" who consider each other. I do not know at which "I" to stop as the actual, and in the moment I stop at one, there is indeed again an "I" which stops it. I become confused and feel a dizziness as if I were looking down into a bottomless abyss.
